Richard Joseph Barber is a composer, teacher, conductor, and piano tuner in Colorado Springs, Colorado. He holds a Bachelor of Music in Public School Music from Western Michigan University and a Master of Music in Applied Vocal Music from the same. His teaching experience spans four decades, during which he has conducted numerous school bands and church choirs. Richard has performed lead roles and solos in works such as Britton's *War Requiem*, Orff’s *Carmina Burana*, Mozart’s *Marriage of Figaro* and others.

In 1994, Richard earned a Bachelor of Pastoral Ministries at Freedom Farm Bible College and went on to pastor several congregations. Many of his musical compositions were written during this time, in order to meet the specific needs of his church choirs. He now leads the choirs at High Country Baptist Church and dotes upon his eleven grandchildren, his wife, Nancy, and their two dogs, Lily and Annie.
